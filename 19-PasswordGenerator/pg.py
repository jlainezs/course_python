"""
Write a generate_password() function that has a length parameter. The length
parameter is an integer of how many characters the generated password should have. For security
reasons, if length is less than 12, the function forcibly sets it to 12 characters anyway.
The password string returned by the function must have at least

one lowercase letter
one uppercase letter
one number
one special character.

The special characters for this exercise are ~!@#$%^&*()_+.
Your solution should import Pythonâ€™s random module to help randomly generate these
passwords.
