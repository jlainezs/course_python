"""
Bubble sort is often the first sorting algorithm taught to computer science students. While it is
too inefficient for use in real-world software, the algorithm is easy to understand. In this last exercise
of the book, weâ€™ll implement this basic sorting algorithm.

Write a bubble_sort() function with a list parameter named numbers. The function
rearranges the values in this list in-place. The function also returns the now-sorted list. There are
many sorting algorithms, but this exercise asks you to implement the bubble sort algorithm.
The objective of this exercise is to write a sorting algorithm, so avoid using Pythonâ€™s sort()
method or sorted() function as that would defeat the purpose of the exercise.
